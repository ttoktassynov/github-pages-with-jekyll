I'm currently undertaking an MSc in Software Systems Engineering at University College London. I'm involved in a project where I contribute to developing an automatic program repair plugin for an IDE.

I'm looking for an internship within organizations involved with software development, product development. In particular I'm keen to use my knowledge of software testing and verification. I am fluent in English, Russian, Kazakh and beginner in French.

My specialties include:
- Software Testing (JUnit)
- Build and environment tools (Maven, Gradle, VS Code, Intellij IDEA)
- Networked systems (TCP/IP)
- Algorithms and Data Structures
- C++ programming language

In my spare time I enjoy solving problems on Leetcode, learning French via Duolingo app and listening to podcast about psychology, brain, entrepreneurship. Do yoga, running and basketball.
